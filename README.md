This Python script demonstrates how to create and manipulate a list using built-in list methods.

What the Code Does:
Creates an empty list called my_list.

Adds values 10, 20, 30, and 40 to the list using .append().

Inserts the value 15 at position 1 using .insert(), shifting the rest of the elements.

Extends the list by adding multiple values [50, 60, 70] at once using .extend().

Removes the item at index 2 using .pop(2), which deletes the third item in the list.

Sorts the list in ascending order using .sort().

Finds the index of the value 30 using .index(30) and prints it.

Prints the final version of the list after all operations.

This script is a practical example of how to build and modify lists in Python, and it helps reinforce understanding of list methods like append, insert, extend, pop, sort, and index.
